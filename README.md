# Modbus Explorer

## About

Modbus explorer is a lightweight cross platform GUI for interrogating Modbus TCP devices.

It supports reading and writing registers and converting from the native u16 data types to many other types.

## Intallation

### Windows

Standalone .exe and an installer are provided.

### Ubuntu

Binaries for ubuntu 24 and 22 are provided. Due to a change in the included  webkit2gtk-4.0 with these distros the correct one should be chosen. If you're on a version of ubuntu older than 24 then the 22 build should work.
Download the binary - navigate to the location in a terminal and make the file executable by running the command `chmod +x ModbusExplorer-ubuntu24` to allow execution of the file. The file can now be double clicked in file explorer to run.
